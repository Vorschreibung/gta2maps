# Zero Tolerance

Giddy up dirtbag, the cops are not fucking around this time 'cause the army
gifted them a brand new ION cannon.

Once they're on to you, you have 14 seconds for their lock-on mechanism to
complete, after which their 69 megaton orbital shaft will catapult your
monkey-ass into outer space.

Word on the street is to stay close to God and find Jesus fucking fast once
they're on to you.

## Features

- Keeping ANY Police Level for longer than 14 seconds will blow you up in a
  large explosion
- There's a fast-respawning Cob Bribe inside the Church to prevent this
- Modified narrowed version of Downtown's Church area
- Weapons mostly on the outskirts
- 1-6 Player Support
- Suggested Game Modes: Any
